Disable alerting via IRC (as found here):
2. Run the following command to identify any problems in the HDFS file system :
    Fix any errors reported by the fsck command.
     hdfs fsck / -list-corruptfileblocks -openforwrite -files -blocks -locations 2>&1 > /tmp/hdfs-fsck.txt
3. Host Decommission (While decommissioning, keep the track of Rack. So once you add the new host, need to change the rack from default)
     For each node, Log on to Cloudera Manager
     Clusters → Prod2 → Hosts
     Select the host to decommission → Actions for selected
           Begin Maintenance (Suppress Alerts/Decommission). 
           Choose Decommission Host(s) and Decommission DataNodes.
4. Remove from Cloudera Manager the decommissioned hosts.
      After host decom we need to refresh stale configuration and run rolling restart for affected services.
    	  ** Reference: https://jira.atlas.llnw.com/browse/SYSDBA-20984
5. Data center HW Replacement
       Notify Client Data Center team the machine can be removed and replaced with new machines.
6. Hostname Setup
       Client will complete the machine setup before we add back to production. 
	   Once done, we should run evaluation on the new nodes. Also copy certificates to path /opt/cloudera/security/
       a. Copy and untar certs from Jump host (db-gw-1) /home/aalgude/security.tar to new hosts on location   /opt/cloudera/security/
       Login to Jump host
        scp /home/aalgude/security.tar NEW_HOST:/tmp/
        Then Login to new host and run
             sudo tar -xvf /tmp/security.tar -C /opt/cloudera/security
       b. Update the location of the cert on /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ by running below command 
  _DIR=/opt/cloudera
     c_rehash "${_DIR}/security/CAcerts/"
     cd "${_DIR}/security/CAcerts/" || exit
  for SRC in *.pem; do
       # shellcheck disable=SC2001
         DST=$(echo "$SRC" | sed 's|pem$|crt|')
         cp -p "${_DIR}/security/CAcerts/${SRC}" "/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/${DST}"
     done
        update-ca-certificates
7.  Add Host to Cloudera Manager
         Once all prechecks are completed, need to add host to the cluster.
         NOTE: Do the installation of CM manually by following below steps.
         Copy repository into /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudera_manager.list
         root@h:/etc/apt/sources.list.d# cat cloudera_manager.list
        deb [arch=amd64] http://archive.cloudera.com/cm6/6.3.1/ubuntu1604/apt xenial-cm6.3.1 contrib
        root@hdp:/etc/apt/sources.list.d#
     Install the agent
     sudo apt-get install cloudera-manager-daemons cloudera-manager-agent
      If you get below error : 
     E: Unable to locate package cloudera-manager-daemons
      E: Unable to locate package cloudera-manager-agent
     Do: apt-get update
     And then Install the agent.
     Setup CM host in /etc/cloudera-scm-agent/config.ini
     server_host=hdp-prd-mgr-cms.llnw.com
Start Cloudera Agent
sudo service cloudera-scm-agent start
sudo service cloudera-scm-agent status
If the health of the server is bad like this 
Login to CM and change the rack setting for the host
Log on to Cloudera Manager → Hosts → HOSTNAME
  8. Add host part of PROD-2 cluster
In Select Host Template, select the “New host recommission” 
 template and make sure to untick the option 
”start newly created roles after applying the host template” or make sure that the option 
”start newly created roles after applying the host template” is not selected. 

9. Verify the role groups for the Datanode, Impala Daemon and Nodemanager by following steps below:
   Go to Prod-2 cluster→  Click on service(Hdfs, Yarn, Impala) → 
   go to instance tab → click on Role groups → on left side column Click on the role 
   Group for respective service DataNode hdp-11-14x, NodeManager hdp-11-14x, 
   ImpalaDaemon hdp-11-14x → Validate the host is added in the group for respective service as shown in below snapshot. :
10. Check the permission and ownership on path /opt/cloudera/security/x509/ with other hosts in the cluster. Make necessary changes. 
   chown hue:hue /opt/cloudera/security/x509/hue*
   chown impala:impala /opt/cloudera/security/x509/impala*
 11. Do rolling restart of all affected services
 12. Host start services and Verification
Hosts → HOSTNAME → Start Roles on Hosts
Confirm that node functions correctly. 
13. Login to hostname and hostname and remove old process logs of flume 
from path /var/run/cloudera-scm-agent/process. Just leave the last one and clear all others.
rm -rf 77241-flume-AGENT 77573-flume-AGENT 77572-flume-AGENT 77562-flume-AGENT 77560-flume-AGENT 77549-flume-AGENT
14. Enable alerting via IRC (as found here)
.unsquelch host
6. HDFS Balancer
Start the balancer removing the new added host from source in HDFS --> Configurations --> Balancer --> Sources
