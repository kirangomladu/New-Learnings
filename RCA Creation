Hello Team,

Issue Reported: Query failing with timeout issue due to load average on hadoop52 increasing.

Issue description: Client was facing an issue on the prod PHX cluster, query failing with timeout exception and on the host Hadoop52 load average increasing.

Error logs/message: FINDINGS:
       Cloudera team noticed that there load_catalog_in_background parameter which was set to true, Cloudera recommends disabling this parameter as it loads the metadata in the background. Below is the link which has more information on that parameter.

        Components of the Impala Server | 6.3.x | Cloudera Documentation 

 
       Use --load_catalog_in_background option to control when the metadata of a table is loaded.

       If set to false, the metadata of a table is loaded when it is referenced for the first time. This means that the first run of a particular query can be slower than subsequent runs. Starting in Impala 2.2, the default for load_catalog_in_background is false.

       If set to true, the catalog service attempts to load metadata for a table even if no query needed that metadata. So metadata will possibly be already loaded when the first query that would need it is run. However, for the following reasons, we recommend not to set the option to true.

       Background load can interfere with query-specific metadata loading. This can happen on startup or after invalidating metadata, with a duration depending on the amount of metadata, and can lead to a seemingly random long running queries that are difficult to diagnose.

       Impala may load metadata for tables that are possibly never used, potentially increasing catalog size and consequently memory usage for both catalog service and Impala Daemon.

 4 RCA: Previously load_catalog_in_background is set to true, to resolve this issue we made it to false

 6 Resolution provided: in order to resolve this issue we set load_catalog_in_background to false and restarted stale configs
